# SisyphusTable
The goal is to make a Sisyphus table. A Sisyphus table is a mechanism that works by moving a magnet below a table of sand to draw a metal ball around the sand, creating intricate shapes in the sand. This project was mainly a side project that doesn’t have too much of a real world impact other than just looking pretty, and even that it sort of fails at because of the loudness of the stepper motor. Still, I learned quite a bit about mechanical engineering during this project, and I think my time wasn’t wasted.

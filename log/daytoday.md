**Day to Day Log:**

Dec 30: Got all the parts together, took pictures of the gathered parts. Fiddled around with the power supply and the chips, ended up blowing the 24v power supply when doing voltage testing. (Probe must have crossed 2 wires that were different polarities)

Dec 31: Cut the axle to the correct length, and attached everything that is supposed to be attached to the axle. Got a 12v battery to replace the exploded PSU, and soldered a power jack.

Jan 3: Got documentation for the chips, loaded code, tested the servos. Everything seems to be in order. Can’t adjust the voltage because I can’t find a small enough screwdriver.

Jan 4: Laser cut all parts, got new parts for the axle ends, and glued together what needed to be glued. 

Jan 5: Finished gluing what needed to be glued, assembled lower assembly. Everything is in order, although we need to adjust the distance between the axle and the stepper motor. 

Jan 10: Designed the final side and bottom panels. Did testing with the ball and sand and magnets

Jan 12: Cut the final side and bottom panels, and designed and adjusted a spiral pattern. All looks good. 

Jan 16: Designed and adjusted a flower pattern. All looks pretty good, the project is finished!

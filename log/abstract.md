**Abstract:**

The goal is to make a Sisyphus table. A Sisyphus table is a mechanism that works by moving a magnet below a table of sand to draw a metal ball around the sand, creating intricate shapes in the sand. 

With our design, a stepper motor turns an axle via a belt, on top of which sits a motorized slider controlled by a stepper motor. This allows for full freedom of movement in a disk area. As the disk spins, the slider can also slide, in order to move the magnet to the appropriate position via an appropriate path. The speed of this action must be controlled in order to not lose magnetism on the metal ball resting in the sand above.

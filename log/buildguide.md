**Build Guide:**

Cut 12mm axle to correct size (185mm)

Attach gear to the correct position in the middle, so it lays flat with the top of the stepper motor if the axle is placed side by side with the stepper motor

Attach slip ring on top of that

Apply liberal amounts of hot glue to the inside of one axle mount. Attach it to the axle on the top facing downward. Allow the glue to cure. 

Attach gear to the stepper motor. 

3D print all parts

Laser-cut the acrylic panels

Attach the stepper motor and an axle mount to the bottom acrylic panel via the screw holes cut in. 

Drop axle into bottom axle mount

Attach the two gears via the belt provided.

Attach top axle mount to the slider via a 3D printed spacer, using mostly screws but also hot glue

Attach magnets to the slider via a 3D printed spacer

Connect slider wires to the slip ring

Attach CNC shield to the Arduino, and attach DRV8825 chips onto the shield

Connect wires accordingly, with 24v power going to the CNC shield, and the stepper motor wires going to their respective chips

Glue Arduino to the bottom plate

Glue power supplies to the bottom plate

Attach side panels

Attach top plate, pour 2cm of sand in

Drop the metal ball on where the magnet is located
